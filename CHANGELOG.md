## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Phase 1 scaffold for a standalone flake, including:
  - `flake.nix`, `default.nix`, and lockfiles
  - NixOS/Home Manager module skeletons under `modules/`
  - CLI package skeletons under `packages/`
  - Shared library placeholders in `lib/r2.nix`
  - `r2-explorer/` Worker subflake scaffold
  - Consumer templates under `templates/`
- Base docs for credentials, sync, sharing, and versioning.
- Generic CI validation workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Reusable validation runner `scripts/ci/validate.sh`.

### Changed

- CI naming made phase-agnostic (`ci.yml`, `validate.sh`).
- Validation docs now use `./scripts/ci/validate.sh`.
- CI defaults to `CI_STRICT=1` for fail-fast cache/network behavior.

### Fixed

- Home Manager `programs.r2-cloud` package list now correctly wraps
  `pkgs.writers.writeBashBin` as a package derivation.
- Standalone import of `homeManagerModules.rclone-config` no longer fails
  when `programs.r2-cloud` options are absent.
